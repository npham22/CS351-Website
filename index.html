                    Hello! Welcome to my personal website! <br>
                    My name is Nguyen Nam Pham. I am studying Computer Science at Cal State East Bay in Hayward, California. 
                    I live in the big city of San Jose. My passion is knowing how computers work, and their associated technologies and algorithms. 
                    My specialty is PC repair although I dabbled in some PC building. 
                    I programmed mainly in Python due to its versatility and ease, but I also know Java and C++.
